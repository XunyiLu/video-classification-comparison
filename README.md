# video-classification-comparison

## Project Overview
My project is a comparison study of three different models for video classification: a fine-tuned InceptionV3 model, a 3D Conv model, and a CNN_RNN model. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on a video classification task and compare their strengths and weaknesses.

## Features
Three different models for video classification: fine-tuned InceptionV3, 3D Conv, and CNN_RNN(InceptionV3+GRU layer)
Comparison of model performance through loss and accuracy curves
Hyperparameter tuning using early stopper and random search algorithm
Discussion of difficulties in model selection, hyperparameter tuning, deployment/UI design
Recommendations for future work and potential limitations of the study

## Requirements:
GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository from Github
2. Install the required packages using pip or conda
3. Download the dataset and store it in the data folder
4. Run the jupyter notebook to train and test the models

## Usage:
1. Open the jupyter notebook
2. Follow the steps to train and test the models
3. View the loss and accuracy curves to compare the performance of the models
4. Adjust the hyperparameters to tune the models further
